Question:
Lou Seal is the mascot for the team that last won the World Series when?
Answer: [ANS]2012[/ANS]
Explanation:
The first path shows Lou Seal as a member of a team that has won the championship in the year 2012. The second and third paths show Lou Seal's team participating but not winning championships in other years (2014 and 2010). Therefore, based on this information we can conclude that Lou Seal's team was most recently crowned champion in 2012. 

Note: This problem requires an understanding of logical deduction from incomplete data. It also tests one's ability to identify relevant pieces of information and make conclusions based upon them. In real-world scenarios, such skills are essential for making informed decisions with limited resources.

Explanation: 
The first path indicates Lou Seal's team was champion of the 2014 World Series. The second path shows they were also champions in 2012. Therefore, we have two possibilities - either one or both years are correct. Since there isn't any information to suggest otherwise, it could be either year.
